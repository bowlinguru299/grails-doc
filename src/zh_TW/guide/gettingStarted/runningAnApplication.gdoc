Grails applications can be run with the built in Tomcat server using the [run-app|commandLine] command which will load a server on port 8080 by default:

{code}
grails run-app
{code}

You can specify a different port by using the @server.port@ argument:

{code}
grails -Dserver.port=8090 run-app
{code}

More information on the [run-app|commandLine] command can be found in the reference guide.
